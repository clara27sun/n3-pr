    <div class="textright"><p><b>Weak AI</b>—also called <b>Narrow AI</b> or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)—is AI trained 
        and focused to perform specific tasks. Weak AI drives most of the AI that surrounds us today. ‘Narrow’
         might be a more accurate descriptor for this type of AI as it is anything but weak; it enables some 
         very robust applications, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, IBM Watson, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
        
         <p><b>Strong AI</b> is made up of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence
             (ASI). Artificial general intelligence (AGI), or general AI, is a theoretical form of AI where a
              machine would have an intelligence equaled to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness
               that has the ability to solve problems, learn, and plan for the future.</p>

        <p class="normaltext">Artificial Super 
            Intelligence (ASI)—also known as superintelligence—would surpass the intelligence and ability
             of the human brain. While strong AI is still entirely theoretical with no practical examples
              in use today, that doesn't mean AI researchers aren't also exploring its development.</p>

    <div class="textleft"><p><b>Deep learning</b> is actually comprised of neural networks. “Deep” in deep learning
         refers to a neural network comprised of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the inputs
          and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm. This is generally represented using the 
          diagram below.</p>
        
         <p>Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the 
            nuances between the two. As mentioned above, both deep learning and machine learning are 
            sub-fields of artificial intelligence, and deep learning is actually a sub-field of machine
             learning.</p>
             <p>"Deep" machine learning can leverage labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm.</p>

        <p class="normaltext">The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each
             algorithm learns. Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, 
             eliminating some of the manual human intervention required and enabling the use of larger data 
             sets.</p>
